<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## 📖 Topic

In this project we will focus on the development and control of an electric vehicle using the STM32F767ZI microcontroller. The device will employ a real-time operating system to manage the motors and other additional components, and the project will be carried out in the STM32CubeIDE software (vérsion 1.13.2), using Ozone for code debugging.

<!-- project objective -->
## 💡 Project Objective
Our project aims to create a circuit based on black lines that the vehicle will follow, guided by infrared sensors. When the vehicle encounters an object at a distance less than 10 cm, it will stop, and a red LED will illuminate. Once the object disappears, the vehicle will resume its path, guided by the infrared sensors. Simultaneously, the distance between the object and the ultrasonic sensor will be displayed on an LCD screen. Additionally, independently from the rest of the project and to verify the proper functioning of the accelerometer, we have created a program that will print the values of the MPU6050 sensor on the LCD screen.
